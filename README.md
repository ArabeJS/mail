Whiteout Mail [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/whiteout-io/mail-html5.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/whiteout-io/mail-html5)
==========

Whiteout Mail is an easy to use email client with integrated OpenPGP encryption written in pure JavaScript. Download the official version under [whiteout.io](http://whiteout.io).

### Features

You can read about product features and our future roadmap in our [FAQ](https://github.com/whiteout-io/mail-html5/wiki/FAQ).

### Privacy and Security

We take the privacy of your data very seriously. Here are some of the technical details:

* Messages are [encrypted end-to-end ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption) using the [OpenPGP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) standard. This means that only you and the recipient can read your mail. Your messages and private PGP key are stored encrypted on your computer.

* Users have the option to use [encrypted private key sync](https://blog.whiteout.io/2014/07/07/secure-pgp-key-sync-a-proposal/) if they want to use Whiteout on multiple devices.

* Like most native email clients whiteout mail uses raw [TCP sockets](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/socket.html) to communicate directly with your mail server via IMAP/SMTP.

* The app is deployed as a [Chrome Packaged App](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps.html) with [auditable static versions](https://github.com/whiteout-io/mail-html5/releases) in order to prevent [problems with host-based security](http://tonyarcieri.com/whats-wrong-with-webcrypto).

* [Content Security Policy (CSP)](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/) is enforced to prevent injection attacks.

* HTML mails are sanitized with [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) and are rendered in a sandboxed iframe.

* Displaying mail images is optional and opt-in by default.

### Reporting bugs and feature requests

* We will launch a bug bounty program later on for independant security researchers. If you find any security vulnerabilities, don't hesitate to contact us [security@whiteout.io](mailto:security@whiteout.io).

* You can also just create an [issue](https://github.com/whiteout-io/mail-html5/issues) on GitHub if you're missing a feature or just want to give us feedback. It would be much appreciated!

### Testing

You can download a prebuilt bundle under [releases](https://github.com/whiteout-io/mail-html5/releases) or build your own from source (requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/), [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli) and [sass](http://sass-lang.com/install)):

    npm install && npm test

This will download all dependencies, run the tests and build the Chrome Packaged App bundle **DEV.zip** which can be installed under [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in developer mode.

### Development
For development you can start a connect dev server:

    grunt dev

Then visit [http://localhost:8580/dist/#/desktop?dev=true](http://localhost:8580/dist/#/desktop?dev=true) for front-end code or [http://localhost:8580/test/unit/](http://localhost:8580/test/unit/) to test JavaScript changes. You can also start a watch task so you don't have rebuild everytime you make a change:

    grunt watch
